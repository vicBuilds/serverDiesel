# serverDiesel

The app is deployed with the link: https://sore-pear-cockatoo-wig.cyclic.app/

API End Point : https://sore-pear-cockatoo-wig.cyclic.app/fetch-diesel-prices

It fetches the data from a server and sends it to an end point. Also send the data back to the client who initiates the request for convinience.

**** Important Note:
The api for fetching the data from newsrain no longer works. I have no other options left other than rapid for fetching the data for free.
